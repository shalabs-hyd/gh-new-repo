Within Kubernetes Cluster, every pod can reach every other pod, this is accomplish by deploying a pod networking solution to the cluster.

Kube-Proxy is a process that runs on each node in the kubernetes cluster.

it is run as a daemon-set, ensuring that atleast one pod of kube-proxy runs per node

Kube-proxy monitors for new services in the cluster. Services are virtual objects residing in memory and have an IP associated it them, they
frontend a set of pods based on label selector mechanism. Kube-proxy runs on all nodes of a cluster and when a service is created, it creates 
a ruleset to forward all traffic to the service to a certain IP and then to the backend pods. It uses IP tables to do so.
