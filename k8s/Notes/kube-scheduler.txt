kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.

The kube-scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pod goes on which node. It doesn't actually place the pod on the nodes, 
that's the job of the kubelet.

Why do you need a Scheduler?

When there are many nodes and many containers we need to be sure that the right pod/container ends up on the right node

the capcacity constrainsts of a node and pod are checked before pod allocation to worker nodes
