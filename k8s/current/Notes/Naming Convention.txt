Notice that the name of the ReplicaSet is always formatted as [DEPLOYMENT-NAME]-[HASH]. This name will become the basis for the 
Pods which are created.

The HASH string is the same as the pod-template-hash label on the ReplicaSet.

To see the labels automatically generated for each Pod, run kubectl get pods --show-labels. The output is similar to:

NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
nginx-deployment-75675f5897-7ci7o   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=75675f5897

Pod-template-hash label 

he pod-template-hash label is added by the Deployment controller to every ReplicaSet that a Deployment creates or adopts.

This label ensures that child ReplicaSets of a Deployment do not overlap. 
It is generated by hashing the PodTemplate of the ReplicaSet and using the resulting hash 
as the label value that is added to the ReplicaSet selector, Pod template labels, and in any 
existing Pods that the ReplicaSet might have

2] When you inspect the Deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed:

NAME lists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.
READY displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.
UP-TO-DATE displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
AVAILABLE displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.

NRUAA -> name, ready (ready/desired), up-to-date, available, Age

3] ReplicaSet output shows the following fields:

NAME - lists the names of the ReplicaSets in the namespace.

DESIRED - displays the desired number of replicas of the application, which you define when you create the Deployment. This is the desired state.

CURRENT - displays how many replicas are currently running.

READY displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.

AGE - displays the amount of time that the application has been running.

NDCRA -> Name, Desired, Current, Ready, Age
